## Wireframes

I have decided to use [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamig.com) to create 3 different wireframes for my website.

### [Desktop Wireframe](wireframes/csdesktop.png)
### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/ipad_wireframe.png)
### [Phone Wireframe](wireframes/phone_wireframe.png)


The wireframes really helped me to give me a perpespective on how the wesbite would be made out at the end. 

## Features
### 1. Existing Features
#### Navigation
The navigation bag that I hava come up with for the website is a basic navbar which comes from materializecss. It has the logo of the website on top left corner.
When the page is opened for the first time you will only have 3 buttons on the navbar which are home, sign in and sign up buttons.
And then once the user is logged in you will only have 5 buttons which are home, find employee, profile, new employee and log out.

#### Home
This page which is the main and first page when user firstly enters the website. On this page the user will see a big picture along with a setence/title within this big picture. Below this picure there are 2 sections which are the about section and the section that tries to explain a little bit what the app is about and then below these 2 sections there is the footer.

#### Log In
The sign in page is the page which the user can log in themselves.

#### Sign up 
The sign up page is the page which the user can register themselves for the first time.

#### Log out
The log out page is the page which the user can log themselves out of the page. Which it takes straigt away to the login page.

#### Find Employee
This page will show you all the employees.
